# Applied-Project-4th-Year

## Description:
A C# Application for my 4th year project as part of a team.
Within this project we are going to create a Brain Training-Type game called BrainWorks. Within this game we have 4 different areas of learning: Attention, Problem-Solving, Memory and Speed.

## Within Attention you will find 5 games that are aimed at improving your attention:

1. Barn Dance: Using Storyboards to change the direction of an Owl image, I will be starting the storyboard which will move the owl from a certain direction. The User has to interpret what kind of Owl is coming into the screen and direct it to the appropriate Owl Hut. There will be Snowy Owls, Barn Owls, Tawny Owls etc and they will all have to be directed appropriately.
2. Tea Total: Using Storyboards to change the look of the tea object, I will be creating a game that shows a tea cup on a 'Conveyor belt'. The user has to complete an 'order' before the cup reaches the end of the conveyor belt. Orders will include, 2 sugars, milk, green tea, etc and will get more complicated with more orders being added so the user has to be quick. The game is designed to test the user's divided attention.
3. Everything has a Porpoise: You will start off with 3 Porpoise fish swimming around a pool, you have to click on each of the 3 fish only once and when this has been done you will move onto the next level where there will be more fish added to the pool. If you click the same fish twice you lose the game, you only progress by clicking all fish once. This gets increasigly difficult the more fish are added and is designed to test your divided attention.
4. Picture Perfect: There will be a picture in front of you. You get a certain amount of seconds to look at the picture before you are asked to recall certain aspects of the picture. The game is designed to test the user's selective attention.
5. Total Recall: There will be a story in words in front of you. You get a certain amount of seconds to look at the story before you are asked to recall certain aspects of the story. The game is designed to test the user's selected attention.

## Within Speed you will find 5 games that are aimed at improving your Speed:

1. Brainbox: Using keys/ Arrows on screen direct an object through a maze and get to the end with the quickest time you can.
2. Down to a tea: An image of a biscuit will appear with some text on it which may/may not be the name of the biscuit it is. You will have 4 options to choose from to guess the right biscuit.
3. Foal Shadow: A silhouette of an animal will appear and then disappear and a new one will appear and the player is asked if this image matches the last one and they will have two options of yes and no.
4. Go with the BuffLow: A number of Buffalo appear on screen and they have to be sorted into herds of the same number by swinging a stick around on screen and when let go that will be your two herds. There needs to be the same number on each side in order to progress.
5. Spot the difference: You will be given an image to inspect. Then two images will appear side by side and you will then have to choose which image is the different one.

## Within Problem-Solving you will find 5 games that are aimed at improving your Problem-Solving Skills:

1. BrainFall: While making use of storyboards and canvas collisions, the aim of the game is to answer as many mathematical questions as possible before any of the rain drops fall to the bottom of the screen. As the game progresses the speed of the drop will increase.
2. Brain Gains: You are given a person who has been working out for X amount of time using Y amount of weight. With this, figure out how much they can lift from a selection of options. Be careful not to lift above your weight!
3. Higher or Lower: The aim of this game is to answer two maths questions at the same time and select the one with the highest answer.You are racing against a clock and will recieve extra time for each correct answer.
4. Manic Maths: You are placed a few paces ahead of a murderer. You move forward each time an answer is given correctly. The murderer moves every few seconds. If you cannot answer the questions quick enough, the game will end...
5. Quick RPG: You are a character in a game and are given a set amount for your stats and have to survive as many battles with enemies for as long as you can.

## Within Memory you will find 5 games hat are aimed at improving your Memory:

1. Shopping List: This is a game where the user starts with one item on their shopping list, each turn they have to add another item to their list and recall all the previous items in order for as many turns as possible. Items can be reused as many times as the user wishes. Two-player functionality could be incorporated in the future.
2. Once & Never Again: In this game the user has to pick one of the items on the screen, the screen will then respawn with a new selection of items. The aim is to not pick one of the previously chosen items.
3. Odd One Out: The user will be shown a selection of images and told to memorise them. After a few seconds they will disappear, then be shown again but in a different order and one will be different. The user must pick out the imposter image, each round the time to memorise the images will become shorter and shorter.
4. Twos a Pair: In this game the user has to find all the hidden pairs of cards on the table. They will briefly be shown then laid facedown on the screen. The user must then flip over the pairs.
5. Sequential: A selection of colours are displayed to the user on the screen, a sequence of colours will be flashed. Starting with three, the number of flashes in the sequence will increase as the user passes more levels.
